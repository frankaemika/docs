FR3 certification remarks
=========================

Congratulations on your new Franka Research 3.
As part of the package you received the documentation including Product Manual Franka Production 3 (110010/1.5/EN).
Even though its title indicates it is for the other Franka robot arm - FP3,
it is in general also valid for Franka Research 3.
We recommend reading this product manual before using the robot. Please be aware that especially
when using the FCI and in general use cases in research applications there might be some deviations from this manual.
Therefore, please consult the following table, where the applicability is stated and check the
referred documentation like the datasheet.
