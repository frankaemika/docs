franka_ros2
===========
.. note::

 ``franka_ros2`` is not supported on Windows.

You can access the changelog of franka_ros2 at `this link <https://github.com/frankarobotics/franka_ros2/blob/humble/CHANGELOG.rst>`_

The `franka_ros2 repo <https://github.com/frankarobotics/franka_ros2>`_ contains a ROS 2 integration of
:doc:`libfranka <libfranka>`.

.. caution::
    franka_ros2 is in rapid development. Anticipate breaking changes. Report bugs on
    `GitHub <https://github.com/frankarobotics/franka_ros2/issues>`_.


Installation
------------

Please refer to the `README.md <https://github.com/frankarobotics/franka_ros2/blob/humble/README.md>`_

MoveIt
------

To see if everything works, you can try to run the MoveIt example on the robot::

    ros2 launch franka_fr3_moveit_config moveit.launch.py robot_ip:=<fci-ip>

Then activate the ``MotionPlanning`` display in RViz.

If you do not have a robot you can still test your setup by running on a dummy hardware::

    ros2 launch franka_fr3_moveit_config moveit.launch.py robot_ip:=dont-care use_fake_hardware:=true


Wait until you can see the green ``You can start planning now!`` message from MoveIt inside the
terminal. Then turn off the ``PlanningScene`` and turn it on again. After that turn on the ``MotionPlanning``.

Namespace enabled launch files
------------------------------

To demonstrate how to launch the robot within a specified namespace, we provide an example launch file located at
``franka_bringup/launch/example.launch.py``.

By default ``example.launch.py`` file is configured to read essential robot configuration details from a YAML file, ``franka.ns-config.yaml``,
located in the franka_bringup/launch/ directory. You may provide a different YAML file by specifying the path to it in the command line.

``franka.ns-config.yaml`` file specifies critical parameters, including:

* The path to the robot's URDF file.
* The namespace to be used for the robot instance.
* Additional configuration details specific to the robot instance.

example.launch.py "includes" ``franka.ns-launch.py`` which defines the core nodes typically required for robot operation..

The franka.ns-launch.py file, in turn, relies on ``ns-controllers.yaml`` to configure the ros2_controller framework.
This configuration ensures that controllers are loaded in a namespace-agnostic manner, supporting consistent behavior across multiple namespaces.

The ns-controllers.yaml file is designed to accommodate zero or more namespaces, provided all namespaces share the same node configuration parameters.

Each of the configuration and launch files (franka.ns-config.yaml, example.launch.py, franka.ns-launch.py, and ns-controllers.yaml)
contains detailed inline documentation to guide users through their structure and usage.  Further information about namespaces in ROS 2 can be found in the
`ROS 2 documentation <https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials/Intermediate/Launch/Using-ROS2-Launch-For-Large-Projects.html#namespaces>`_.

To execute any of the example controllers defined in ns-controllers.yaml, you can use the example.launch.py launch file and specify
the desired controller name as a command-line argument.

First - modify ``franka.ns-config.yaml`` as appropriate for your setup.

Then, for example, to run the *move_to_start_example_controller*, use the following command:

.. code-block:: shell

    ros2 launch franka_bringup example.launch.py controller_name:=move_to_start_example_controller



Example Controllers
-------------------

This repo comes with a few example controllers located in the ``franka_example_controllers`` package.

The following launch files are executed with the gripper by default. If you
do not have the gripper attached you can disable the gripper in the launch file with ``load_gripper:=false``.

Move-to-start
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This controller moves the robot to its home configuration.

.. code-block:: shell

    ros2 launch franka_bringup example.launch.py controller_name:=move_to_start_example_controller

.. _gravity_example:

Gravity Compensation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is the simplest controller that we have and is a good starting point to write your own.
It sends zero as torque command to all joints, which means that the robot only compensates its own weight.

.. code-block:: shell

    ros2 launch franka_bringup example.launch.py controller_name:=gravity_compensation_example_controller

Gripper Example
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Demonstrates the Franka *Action Interface* for controlling the Franka Hand (aka: Gripper). The controller submits *Goals* to repeatedly close, then reopen, the gripper given a hard-coded target grasp size with epsilon. It evaluates whether the grasp is successful or
failed based on the object's size and the defined tolerances.

.. code-block:: shell

    ros2 launch franka_bringup example.launch.py controller_name:=gripper_example_controller


Joint Impedance Example
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The example moves joints 4 and 5 in a periodic movement that is very compliant. You can try to move the
joints while it is running.

.. code-block:: shell

    ros2 launch franka_bringup example.launch.py controller_name:=joint_impedance_example_controller

Joint Impedance With IK Example
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The example uses the LMA-Orocos solver from MoveIt service to compute the joint positions for the desired pose.
The desired pose is to move the end-effector periodically in x and z directions. You can change the kinematic solver
in the franka_fr3_moveit_config package, kinematics.yaml file.

.. code-block:: shell

    ros2 launch franka_bringup joint_impedance_with_ik_example_controller.launch.py


Model Example Controller
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This is a read-only controller which prints the coriolis force vector, gravity force vector, pose matrix of Joint4,
Joint4 body jacobian and end-effector jacobian with respect to the base frame.

.. code-block:: shell

    ros2 launch franka_bringup example.launch.py controller_name:=model_example_controller

Joint Position Example
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This example sends periodic position commands to the robot.

.. code-block:: shell

    ros2 launch franka_bringup example.launch.py controller_name:=joint_position_example_controller

Joint Velocity Example
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This example sends periodic velocity commands to the 4th and 5th joint of the robot.

.. code-block:: shell

    ros2 launch franka_bringup example.launch.py controller_name:=joint_velocity_example_controller

Cartesian Pose Example
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This example uses the CartesianPose interface to send periodic pose commands to the robot.

.. code-block:: shell

    ros2 launch franka_bringup example.launch.py controller_name:=cartesian_pose_example_controller

Cartesian Orientation Example
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This example uses CartesianOrientation interface to send periodic orientation commands around X axis of the end effector of the robot.

.. code-block:: shell

    ros2 launch franka_bringup example.launch.py controller_name:=cartesian_orientation_example_controller

Cartesian Pose Elbow Example
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This example sends periodic elbow commands while keeping the end effector pose constant.

.. code-block:: shell

    ros2 launch franka_bringup example.launch.py controller_name:=cartesian_elbow_example_controller

Cartesian Velocity Example
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This example uses the CartesianVelocity interface to send periodic velocity commands to the robot.

.. code-block:: shell

    ros2 launch franka_bringup example.launch.py controller_name:=cartesian_velocity_example_controller

Cartesian Elbow Example
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This example uses the CartesianElbow interface to send periodic elbow commands to the robot while keeping the end effector velocity constant.

.. code-block:: shell

    ros2 launch franka_bringup example.launch.py controller_name:=elbow_example_controller


Package Descriptions
--------------------

This section contains more detailed descriptions of what each package does. In general the package structure tries to
adhere to the structure that is proposed
`here <https://rtw.stoglrobotics.de/master/guidelines/robot_package_structure.html>`_.


franka_bringup
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This package contains the launch files for the examples as well as the basic ``franka.launch.py`` launch file, that
can be used to start the robot without any controllers.

When you start the robot with::

    ros2 launch franka_bringup franka.launch.py arm_id:=fr3 robot_ip:=<fci-ip> use_rviz:=true

There is no controller running apart from the ``joint_state_broadcaster``. However, a connection with the robot is still
established and the current robot pose is visualized in RViz. In this mode the robot can be guided when the user stop
button is pressed. However, once a controller that uses the ``effort_command_interface`` is started, the robot will be
using the torque interface from libfranka. For example it is possible to launch the
``gravity_compensation_example_controller`` by running::

    ros2 control load_controller --set-state active  gravity_compensation_example_controller

This is the equivalent of running the ``gravity_compensation_example_controller`` example mentioned in
:ref:`Gravity Compensation <gravity_example>`.

When the controller is stopped with::

    ros2 control set_controller_state gravity_compensation_example_controller inactive

the robot will stop the torque control and will only send its current state over the FCI.

You can now choose to start the same controller again with::

    ros2 control set_controller_state gravity_compensation_example_controller active

or load and start a different one::

    ros2 control load_controller --set-state active joint_impedance_example_controller


.. _franka_description:

franka_description
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. warning::
    As of version 0.1.14 the franka_description package is not available in the franka_ros2 repository.
    It is available in a separate repository `Franka Description <https://github.com/frankarobotics/franka_description>`_.

This package contains the xacro files and meshes that are used to visualize the robot.
Further, it contains a launch file that visualizes the robot model without access to a real robot::

    ros2 launch franka_description visualize_franka.launch.py load_gripper:=<true|false>


.. _franka_example_controllers:

franka_example_controllers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This package contains a few controllers that can be seen as example of how to write controllers in ROS 2. Currently,
a controller only has access to measured joint positions and joint velocities. Based on this information the controller
can send torque commands. It is currently not possible to use other interfaces like the joint position interface.

franka_gripper
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This package contains the ``franka_gripper_node`` for interfacing with the ``Franka Hand``.

The ``franka_gripper_node`` provides the following actions:

* ``homing`` - homes the gripper and updates the maximum width given the mounted fingers.
* ``move`` - moves to a target width with the defined speed.
* ``grasp`` - tries to grasp at the desired width with the desired force while closing with the given speed. The operation is successful if the
  distance ``d`` between the gripper fingers is ``width - epsilon.inner < d < width + epsilon.outer``
* ``gripper_action`` - a special grasping action for MoveIt.

Also, there is a ``stop`` service that aborts gripper actions and stops grasping.


Use the following launch file to start the gripper::

    ros2 launch franka_gripper gripper.launch.py robot_ip:=<fci-ip>


In a different tab you can now perform the homing and send a grasp command.::


    ros2 action send_goal /fr3_gripper/homing franka_msgs/action/Homing {}
    ros2 action send_goal -f /fr3_gripper/grasp franka_msgs/action/Grasp "{width: 0.00, speed: 0.03, force: 50}"

The inner and outer epsilon are 0.005 meter per default. You can also explicitly set the epsilon::

    ros2 action send_goal -f /fr3_gripper/grasp franka_msgs/action/Grasp "{width: 0.00, speed: 0.03, force: 50, epsilon: {inner: 0.01, outer: 0.01}}"

To stop the grasping, you can use ``stop`` service.::

    ros2 service call /fr3_gripper/stop std_srvs/srv/Trigger {}

.. _franka_hardware:

franka_hardware
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. important::
    Breaking changes as of 0.1.14 release: ``franka_hardware`` robot_state and robot_model will be prefixed by the ``arm_id``.

        - ``panda/robot_model  -> ${arm_id}/robot_model``
        - ``panda/robot_state  -> ${arm_id}/robot_state``

    There is no change with the state and command interfaces naming. They are prefixed with the joint names in the URDF.

This package contains the ``franka_hardware`` plugin needed for `ros2_control <https://control.ros.org/humble/index.html>`_.
The plugin is loaded from the URDF of the robot and passed to the controller manager via the robot description.
It provides for each joint:

* a ``position state interface`` that contains the measured joint position.
* a ``velocity state interface`` that contains the measured joint velocity.
* an ``effort state interface`` that contains the measured link-side joint torques.
* an ``initial_position state interface`` that contains the initial joint position of the robot.
* an ``effort command interface`` that contains the desired joint torques without gravity.
* a  ``position command interface`` that contains the desired joint position.
* a  ``velocity command interface`` that contains the desired joint velocity.

In addition

* a ``franka_robot_state`` that contains the robot state information, `franka_robot_state <https://shorturl.at/wajZV>`_.
* a ``franka_robot_model_interface`` that contains the pointer to the model object.

.. important::
    ``franka_robot_state`` and ``franka_robot_model_interface`` state interfaces should not be used directly from hardware state interface.
    Rather, they should be utilized by the :ref:`franka_semantic_components` interface.

The IP of the robot is read over a parameter from the URDF.

.. _franka_semantic_components:

franka_semantic_components
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This package contains franka_robot_model, franka_robot_state and cartesian command classes.
These classes are used to convert franka_robot_model object and franka_robot_state objects,
which are stored in the hardware_state_interface as a double pointer.

For further reference on how to use these classes:
`Franka Robot State Broadcaster <https://github.com/frankarobotics/franka_ros2/tree/humble/franka_robot_state_broadcaster>`_
and
`Franka Example Controllers(model_example_controller)
<https://github.com/frankarobotics/franka_ros2/blob/humble/franka_example_controllers/src/model_example_controller.cpp>`_

- Cartesian Pose Interface:

This interface is used to send Cartesian pose commands to the robot by using the loaned command interfaces.
FrankaSemanticComponentInterface class is handling the loaned command interfaces and state interfaces.
While starting the cartesian pose interface, the user needs to pass a boolean flag to the constructor
to indicate whether the interface is for the elbow or not.

.. code-block:: cpp

   auto is_elbow_active = false;
   CartesianPoseInterface cartesian_pose_interface(is_elbow_active);

This interface allows users to read the current pose command interface values set by the franka hardware interface.

.. code-block:: cpp

   std::array<double, 16> pose;
   pose = cartesian_pose_interface.getInitialPoseMatrix();

One could also read quaternion and translation values in Eigen format.

.. code-block:: cpp

    Eigen::Quaterniond quaternion;
    Eigen::Vector3d translation;
    std::tie(quaternion, translation) = cartesian_pose_interface.getInitialOrientationAndTranslation();

After setting up the cartesian interface, you need to ``assign_loaned_command_interfaces`` and ``assign_loaned_state_interfaces`` in your controller.
This needs to be done in the on_activate() function of the controller. Examples can be found in the
`assign loaned comamand interface example
<https://shorturl.at/nmebx>`_

.. code-block:: cpp

    cartesian_pose_interface.assign_loaned_command_interfaces(command_interfaces_);
    cartesian_pose_interface.assign_loaned_state_interfaces(state_interfaces_);

In the update function of the controller you can send pose commands to the robot.

.. code-block:: cpp

    std::array<double, 16> pose;
    pose = {1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0.5, 0, 0.5, 1};
    cartesian_pose_interface.setCommanded(pose);

Or you can send quaternion, translation values in Eigen format.

.. code-block:: cpp

    Eigen::Quaterniond quaternion(1, 0, 0, 0);
    Eigen::Vector3d translation(0.5, 0, 0.5);
    cartesian_pose_interface.setCommand(quaternion, translation);

- Cartesian Velocity Interface:

This interface is used to send Cartesian velocity commands to the robot by using the loaned command interfaces.
FrankaSemanticComponentInterface class is handling the loaned command interfaces and state interfaces.

.. code-block:: cpp

    auto is_elbow_active = false;
    CartesianVelocityInterface cartesian_velocity_interface(is_elbow_active);

To send the velocity command to the robot, you need to assign_loaned_command_interface in your custom controller.

.. code-block:: cpp

    cartesian_velocity_interface.assign_loaned_command_interface(command_interfaces_);

In the update function of the controller you can send cartesian velocity command to the robot.

.. code-block:: cpp

    std::array<double, 6> cartesian_velocity;
    cartesian_velocity = {0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.1};
    cartesian_velocity_interface.setCommand(cartesian_velocity);

.. _franka_robot_state_broadcaster:

franka_robot_state_broadcaster
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This package contains read-only franka_robot_state_broadcaster controller.
It publishes franka_robot_state topic to the topic named `/franka_robot_state_broadcaster/robot_state`.
This controller node is spawned by franka_launch.py in the franka_bringup.
Therefore, all the examples that include the franka_launch.py publishes the robot_state topic.

.. _franka_fr3_moveit_config:

franka_fr3_moveit_config
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This package contains the configuration for MoveIt2. There is a new move group called
``panda_manipulator`` that has its tip between the fingers of the gripper and has its Z-axis rotated by -45 degrees, so
that the X-axis is now facing forward, making it easier to use. The ``panda_arm`` move group is still available
for backward compatibility. New applications should use the new ``panda_manipulator`` move group instead.

.. figure:: _static/move-groups.png
    :align: center
    :figclass: align-center

    Visualization of the old and the new move group

franka_msgs
^^^^^^^^^^^

This package contains the definitions for the different gripper actions and robot state message.


joint_effort_trajectory_controller
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This package contains a modified joint_trajectory_controller that can use the effort interface of the
``franka_hardware::FrankaHardwareInterface``. It is based on this
`Pull request <https://github.com/ros-controls/ros2_controllers/pull/225>`_.

.. note::
    This package will be soon deleted as the fix is available in
    `ros2_controllers <https://github.com/ros-controls/ros2_controllers/tree/master/joint_trajectory_controller>`_ master branch.
    As soon as, it's backported to Humble, it will be deleted from franka_ros2 repository.


franka_gazebo
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. important::

    Minimum necessary `franka_description` version is 0.3.0.
    You can clone franka_description package from https://github.com/frankarobotics/franka_description.

A project integrating Franka ROS 2 with the Gazebo simulator.

Launch RVIZ + Gazebo
""""""""""""""""""""

Launch an example which spawns RVIZ and Gazebo showing the robot:


.. code-block:: shell

    ros2 launch franka_gazebo_bringup visualize_franka_robot.launch.py

If you want to display another robot, you can define the arm_id:

.. code-block:: shell

    ros2 launch franka_gazebo_bringup visualize_franka_robot.launch.py arm_id:=fp3

If you want to start the simulation including the franka_hand:

.. code-block:: shell

    ros2 launch franka_gazebo_bringup visualize_franka_robot.launch.py load_gripper:=true franka_hand:='franka_hand'

Joint Velocity Control Example with Gazebo
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Before starting, be sure to build `franka_example_controllers` and `franka_description` packages.
`franka_description` must have the minimum version of 0.3.0.


.. code-block:: shell

    colcon build --packages-select franka_example_controllers


Now you can launch the velocity example with Gazebo simulator.

.. code-block:: shell

    ros2 launch franka_gazebo_bringup gazebo_joint_velocity_controller_example.launch.py load_gripper:=true franka_hand:='franka_hand'


Keep in mind that the gripper joint has a bug with the joint velocity controller.
If you are interested in controlling the gripper please use joint position interface.


Joint Position Control Example with Gazebo
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

To run the joint position control example you need to have the required software listed in the joint velocity control section.

Then you can run with the following command.

.. code-block:: shell

    ros2 launch franka_gazebo_bringup gazebo_joint_position_controller_example.launch.py load_gripper:=true franka_hand:='franka_hand'


Joint Impedance Control Example with Gazebo
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

For running torque example. You must compile the `franka_ign_ros2_control` package located under `franka_gazebo`.
You can compile `franka_ign_ros2_control` with the following command.

.. code-block:: shell

    colcon build --packages-select franka_ign_ros2_control

Then source your workspace.

.. code-block:: shell

    source install/setup.sh

Then you can run the impedance control example.

.. code-block:: shell

    ros2 launch franka_gazebo_bringup gazebo_joint_impedance_controller_example.launch.py load_gripper:=true franka_hand:='franka_hand'


Throubleshooting
""""""""""""""""

If you experience that Gazebo can't find your model files, try to include the workspace. E.g.


.. code-block:: shell

    export GZ_SIM_RESOURCE_PATH=${GZ_SIM_RESOURCE_PATH}:/workspaces/src/


Differences between franka_ros and franka_ros2
----------------------------------------------

This section gives an overview of the fundamental changes between ``franka_ros`` and ``franka_ros2``.

franka_gripper
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* All topics and actions were previously prefixed with ``franka_gripper``. This prefix was renamed to ``panda_gripper``
  to enable, in the future, a workflow where all prefixes are based on the ``arm_id``
  to effortlessly enable multi arm setups.

* The ``stop`` action is now a service action as it is not preemptable.

* All actions (apart from the ``gripper_action``) have the current gripper width as feedback.

franka_visualization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This package does not exist anymore. However, :ref:`franka_description` provides a launch file to visualize the robot
model without a connection to a robot.

franka_control
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This package does not exist anymore. The connection to the robot is provided by the hardware plugin in
the :ref:`franka_hardware` package. The actions and services that it provided are currently
not offered in ``franka_ros2``.


Writing Controllers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Compared to ``franka_ros`` we currently offer a reduced set of controller interfaces:

* Joint positions
* Joint velocities
* Measured torques
* Franka robot state
* Franka robot model

.. important::
    Franka robot state is published through :ref:`franka_robot_state_broadcaster`
    package to the topic named  `/franka_robot_state_broadcaster/robot_state`

.. important::
    Both Franka robot state and Franka robot model are advised to use through :ref:`franka_semantic_components` class.
    They are stored in the state_interface as double pointers and casted back to their original objects inside the franka_semantic_component class.

    Example of using franka_model can be found in the franka_example_controllers package:
    `model_example_controller <https://github.com/frankarobotics/franka_ros2/blob/humble/franka_example_controllers/src/model_example_controller.cpp>`_.


You can base your own controller on one of the :ref:`franka_example_controllers`. To compute kinematic
and dynamic quantities of the robot you can use the joint states and the URDF of the robot in libraries like
`KDL <https://www.orocos.org/kdl/user-manual>`_ (of which there is also a ROS 2 package available).

Non-realtime robot parameter setting
------------------------------------

Non-realtime robot parameter setting can be done via ROS 2 services. They are advertised after the robot hardware is initialized.

Service names are given below::

 * /service_server/set_cartesian_stiffness
 * /service_server/set_force_torque_collision_behavior
 * /service_server/set_full_collision_behavior
 * /service_server/set_joint_stiffness
 * /service_server/set_load
 * /service_server/set_parameters
 * /service_server/set_parameters_atomically
 * /service_server/set_stiffness_frame
 * /service_server/set_tcp_frame

Service message descriptions are given below.

 * ``franka_msgs::srv::SetJointStiffness`` specifies joint stiffness for the internal controller
   (damping is automatically derived from the stiffness).
 * ``franka_msgs::srv::SetCartesianStiffness`` specifies Cartesian stiffness for the internal
   controller (damping is automatically derived from the stiffness).
 * ``franka_msgs::srv::SetTCPFrame`` specifies the transformation from <arm_id>_EE (end effector) to
   <arm_id>_NE (nominal end effector) frame. The transformation from flange to end effector frame
   is split into two transformations: <arm_id>_EE to <arm_id>_NE frame and <arm_id>_NE to
   <arm_id>_link8 frame. The transformation from <arm_id>_NE to <arm_id>_link8 frame can only be
   set through the administrator's interface.
 * ``franka_msgs::srv::SetStiffnessFrame`` specifies the transformation from <arm_id>_K to <arm_id>_EE frame.
 * ``franka_msgs::srv::SetForceTorqueCollisionBehavior`` sets thresholds for external Cartesian
   wrenches to configure the collision reflex.
 * ``franka_msgs::srv::SetFullCollisionBehavior`` sets thresholds for external forces on Cartesian
   and joint level to configure the collision reflex.
 * ``franka_msgs::srv::SetLoad`` sets an external load to compensate (e.g. of a grasped object).

Launch franka_bringup/franka.launch.py file to initialize robot hardware::

    ros2 launch franka_bringup franka.launch.py robot_ip:=<fci-ip>

Here is a minimal example:

.. code-block:: shell

    ros2 service call /service_server/set_joint_stif
    fness franka_msgs/srv/SetJointStiffness "{joint_stiffness: [1000.0, 1000.0, 10
    00.0, 1000.0, 1000.0, 1000.0, 1000.0]}"

.. important::

    Non-realtime parameter setting can only be done when the robot hardware is in `idle` mode.
    If a controller is active and claims command interface this will put the robot in the `move` mode.
    In `move` mode non-realtime param setting is not possible.

.. important::

    The <arm_id>_EE frame denotes the part of the
    configurable end effector frame which can be adjusted during run time through `franka_ros`. The
    <arm_id>_K frame marks the center of the internal
    Cartesian impedance. It also serves as a reference frame for external wrenches. *Neither the
    <arm_id>_EE nor the <arm_id>_K are contained in the URDF as they can be changed at run time*.
    By default, <arm_id> is set to "panda".

    .. figure:: _static/frames.svg
        :align: center
        :figclass: align-center

        Overview of the end-effector frames.

Non-realtime ROS 2 actions
--------------------------

Non-realtime ROS 2 actions can be done via the `ActionServer`. Following actions are available:

* ``/action_server/error_recovery`` - Recovers automatically from a robot error.

The used messages are:

* ``franka_msgs::action::ErrorRecovery`` - no parameters.

Example usage:::

    ros2 action send_goal /action_server/error_recovery franka_msgs/action/ErrorRecovery {}

Known Issues
------------

* When using the ``fake_hardware`` with MoveIt, it takes some time until the default position is applied.
