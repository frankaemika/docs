Matlab toolbox dependencies
===========================

The following Mathworks products are required: 

* `Matlab <https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html>`_ (:ref:`compatibility-franka-matlab`)
* `Simulink <https://www.mathworks.com/products/simulink.html>`_
* `Simulink Coder <https://www.mathworks.com/products/simulink-coder.html>`_

Some of demos provided with the franka_matlab could potentially need either of the following toolboxes:

* `Matlab Coder <https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab-coder.html>`_ (cartesian_impedance_control.slx, force_control.slx)
* `Stateflow <https://www.mathworks.com/products/stateflow.html>`_ (grasp_object.slx)
* `Matlab Robotics Toolbox <https://www.mathworks.com/products/robotics.html>`_ with Matlab R2021b or greater (pick_and_place_with_RRT.mlx)
